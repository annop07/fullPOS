# fullPOS Project

This repository contains a web-based Point of Sale (POS) application that supports in-store sales, reservations, and food ordering via QR Code. Users can scan a QR code to browse the menu and place orders, while the system manages orders, calculates payments, and handles data storage through a database managed with phpMyAdmin. The application is developed using Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Prisma.
